        <p>I feel very happy when I write poems,it gives me internsl enthusism . Through my blog I am able to share my poems and spread it among many people .when anyone admire on my poems it gives me internal plesure and motivated me to write another poem .I write poems in hindi and english languages....As we know Poetry is when an emotion has found its thought and the thought has found words.
        Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things.</p>
